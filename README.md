# ReceptMingel

This is my final project at the 2 year long Front End Development program at Medieinstitutet, Gothenburg, Sweden.
Built with MERN-stack with a little Styletron for the css during one hectic month üå±

### Small summary from my exam paper: 

When I started my journey at Medieinstitutet approximately seventeen months ago I had never touched any code besides maybe some html and css, (if you can even count that as coding) in my whole life. When I several months later where asked ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do for your graduation assignment?‚Äù I knew, not what I necessarily wanted to do, but what I HAD to do. I had to prove for my self that I have grown and I had to keep growing .

The assignment I chose to prove myself with is a digital platform where users can store their recipes on a database. I wanted to give the users a safe place where they can work on their recipes, and if they feel like they want to share it with other users on the platform, it should be easy done. I want the users to feel like they don‚Äôt need do be the next masterchef to get their recipes up on my platform. But if they don√§t want to share, that‚Äôs ok to. My dream for the platform is that it will become a small little community where all recipe-makers feel welcomed.
Building this platform with a MERN stack with Styletron as a toolkit for my CSS has surely been a struggle. I have mostly battled with technical issues and my own stubbornness. It‚Äôs sometimes hard to stop coding when your deep into problem solving, especially as code has the ability to whisper ‚ÄúCome on, you‚Äôve almost solved, just a little more‚Äù for hours straight.

At the end of my journey with Medieinstitutet I can easily say that I‚Äôve accomplished almost everything I set off to do with this assignment: I made a platform that‚Äôs fun and sparks my interest to develop it even further. That platform is ReceptMingel.  Hopefully we will grow together, and the platform will force me to learn new techniques so I can return the favour by giving it cool new features.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
